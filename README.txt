I did the extra credit. The user now can drag the card to another section and I can allow user to place the card anywhere within a particular section, not just at the end. 

When you click anywhere of the card to start the drag, all the "move here" buttons will appear at the first, and then you drag the card to anywhere the button is. Since the "move here" button is at the left side of the page, you need to drag the card to the left side of the page! I know it is not that natural, but that is what I can do now. Thank you!
